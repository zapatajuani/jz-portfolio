I joined a New Zealand engineering company where I worked as an electrical drawing designer, developing in-house design standards and programming work. I developed Python scripts to automate tasks. I worked on the development of a web application for GPS tracking with IOT devices, involving both backend and frontend design. Constantly improving and working to bring the best quality and reliability to customers.
<br><br>

Because of my interest in the subject, I was given small tasks to automate *data entry* processes. I used the *Openpyxl* and *Python* libraries to speed up the loading of data into the company's standard spreadsheets.
<br><br>

**2** years ago I was asked to develop a web application that could track various devices and sensors using IOT technology. I was in charge of the project:

<br><br>

- <img src="/svg/check.svg" alt="check-icon" class="icon-md extra"> Establish the connection between the gateways and the server running the application.
<br><br>

- <img src="/svg/check.svg" alt="check-icon" class="icon-md extra"> I developed the RestAPI server using <font color="#62DE67">**Python**</font> and <font color="#62DE67">**FastAPI**</font>. I designed the various endpoints for the <font color="#62DE67">**MySQL**</font> database, the IOT sensors and the *front-end*.
