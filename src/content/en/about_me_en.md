My name is Juan Ignacio, I am an 
<font color="#62DE67">**electronic technician**</font>
and I have 
<font color="#62DE67">**5**</font>
years of experience in software development and programming, and
<font color="#62DE67">**2**</font>
years doing fullstack and data analysis work.
<br><br>

I graduated in **2015** from a technical college where I learned several skills in logic, mathematics and problem solving. I specialised in the design of electronic circuits and industrial control installations:

<br><br>

- <img src="/svg/check.svg" alt="check-icon" class="icon-md"> I designed and implemented circuits with integrated circuits such as the LM741, LM555, logic gates and others.
<br><br>

- <img src="/svg/check.svg" alt="check-icon" class="icon-md"> I worked with PID closed-loop control circuits.
<br><br>

- <img src="/svg/check.svg" alt="check-icon" class="icon-md"> I programmed PIC microcontrollers in C language and used them in control and automation circuits.
<br><br>

- <img src="/svg/check.svg" alt="check-icon" class="icon-md extra"> I implemented solutions by designing and programming the Schneider PLC logic and connecting the equipment, motors and sensors.
<br><br>

When I finished high school, I turned my academic path towards the sciences and began studying for a degree in astronomy.
<br><br>

I spent several years there, where I was able to consolidate my knowledge of advanced mathematics, multivariable calculus, algebra and linear algebra, advanced physics, among others. It also boosted my critical thinking and further developed my problem-solving skills.
<br><br>

In **2019** I started working remotely for New Zealand in electrical design and engineering, designing wiring diagrams with AutoCAD Electrical. At the same time, and because the career I was in was oriented towards the use of software, I took up the study of software development on my own and accompanied it with courses. I became interested in the 
<font color="#62DE67">**Python**</font>
language in particular. And from there I started adding other **languages** (*JavaScript*, *HTML*, *CSS*, *PHP*, *SQL*) and **frameworks** (*React*, *NodeJS*, *Express*, *Astro*, *Flask*, *FastAPI*, *Selenium*, *BeautifulSoup*, *MySQL*, among others).
<br><br>

In **2021**, thanks to my good performance, I joined a New Zealand design and engineering company.
<br><br>

Since then, I have been developing in the professional environment of the sector and, in addition, expanding my knowledge of programming and development.
